# Large Reasoning Models Are (Not Yet) Multilingual Latent Reasoners

This repository contains the codebase for the paper **_Large Reasoning Models Are (Not Yet) Multilingual Latent Reasoners_**.

We study **latent reasoning** in large reasoning models (LRMs) across **11 languages**, using **truncation-based probing**, **logit lens analysis**, and **representation-level similarity analysis** to understand how predictions emerge internally before answers are explicitly produced in the reasoning traces.

---

## Overview

The codebase supports four core components of the paper:

1. **Reasoning trace generation** across languages  
2. **Truncation-based latent reasoning evaluation**  
3. **Internal dynamics analysis**, including logit lens and hidden-state similarity  
4. **Memorization vs. latent reasoning**

The overall workflow mirrors the experimental pipeline in the paper.

## Core Components

### 🔹 Reasoning Trace Generation

- **`run.sh`**  
  Generates full chain-of-thought reasoning traces for each language.

- **`run.py`**  
  Main driver script for multilingual reasoning generation and evaluation.

---

### 🔹 Truncation-Based Latent Reasoning

These scripts probe *when* correct predictions emerge as reasoning traces are progressively truncated.

- **`run_truncation.py`**  
  Evaluates model accuracy given partial reasoning traces.

- **`run_truncations.sh`**  
  Runs truncation experiments across languages, models, and truncation ratios.

This corresponds to the **latent prediction formation** analysis in the paper.

---

### 🔹 Internal Prediction Dynamics

#### Logit Lens Analysis
Tracks how the model’s predicted answer evolves across layers and reasoning steps.

- **`run_logitlens_dynamics.py`**  
- **`run_logitlens_dynamics.sh`**

#### Hidden-State Representation Analysis
Used for cross-lingual similarity and alignment analysis.

- **`run_save_hidden_states.py`**  
  Saves the hidden state of the last token at each reasoning step for a fixed set of truncation ratios.

---

## Analysis Utilities (`analysis/`)

This directory contains scripts for post-hoc analysis and robustness checks:

- **`calculate_trunc_acc.py`**  
  Computes truncation-based accuracy metrics.

- **`compute_cosine_sim.py`**, **`compute_all_pairs_cosine_similarity.py`**  
  Representation similarity analysis across languages and layers.

- **`create_counterfactuals.py`**  
  Generates controlled counterfactual edits for memorization vs. reasoning tests.

- **`run_memorization_counterfactual_vllm.py`**  
  Generates the responses from LRMs on the editted counterfactuals.

- **`run_counterfactual_solvability_gemini.py`**  
  Counterfactual solvability and memorization diagnostics.

- **`memorization_test_helper.py`**, **`helper.py`**  
  Shared analysis utilities.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate multilingual reasoning traces
bash run.sh

# 2. Run truncation-based latent reasoning evaluation
bash run_truncations.sh

# 3. Analyze internal prediction dynamics (logit lens)
bash run_logitlens_dynamics.sh

# 4. Save hidden states for representation similarity analysis
python run_save_hidden_states.py
```
